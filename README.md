# Fluctuation–Dissipation Validation via Dice Simulation

This project uses dice simulations to **numerically validate the Fluctuation–Dissipation Theorem (FDT)**.  
By rolling dice many times, the probabilities of outcomes and their fluctuations are compared with theoretical predictions.

## Code Structure
- main.py → generates random dice outcomes, computes probabilities, RMS fluctuations, and compares with theory.

## Important Variables
- N_throws → number of dice throws
- faces → number of sides (default: 6)
- bins → histogram bins

## How to Interact
1. Open main.py.
2. Change N_throws (e.g., from 10^3 to 10^6) to see how fluctuations shrink.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Physical/Statistical Intuition
- Variance of probabilities scales as:
  σ ~ 1 / √N
- More dice → smoother distributions.
- Small N → large statistical fluctuations.

## Numerical Models
- Monte Carlo random sampling
- Law of Large Numbers
- Fluctuation–Dissipation scaling (1/√N law)
